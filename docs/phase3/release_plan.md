Phase 3 — Release Plan & Pilot Rollout

Goals:
- Pilot with a controlled group (schools / parent opt-in) to validate personalization and scaling.
- Measure retention, hint effectiveness, latency, and cost per session.

Phases:
1. Internal alpha: small team, smoke tests, and monitoring validation.
2. Closed pilot: 1–2 partner schools, limited regions; collect qualitative feedback.
3. Gradual ramp: expand user base by region, monitor costs and provider failover.
4. Public release: after meeting success metrics and audit signoffs.

Success metrics:
- 7-day retention for pilot cohort >= X% (define target).
- Average hint latency < 500ms (regional target).
- LLM cost per active user < $Y/day (budget target).

Operational readiness:
- On-call rota, incident runbooks, and rollback plan.
- Legal signoffs for COPPA and privacy.

Next steps:
- Draft pilot invitation and consent flows.
- Prepare dashboards and baselines for target metrics.
