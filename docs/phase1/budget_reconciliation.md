Budget Reconciliation — Phase 1

Summary:
- SRS earlier listed Development estimate: $60,000 - $85,000 (appears to be an MVP minimal estimate).
- Project Plan itemized a more realistic full-MVP cost: $197,010 (includes 8-member team for 24 weeks).

Recommendation:
- Use $197,010 as canonical MVP budget for planning and staffing.
- Provide contingency 10% ($19,701) and present final approved budget: $216,711.

Breakdown (high level):
- Personnel (24 weeks, 8 FTEs): $160,600
- Tools & Software: $3,000
- Cloud (dev/test): $4,500
- Legal & Compliance: $5,500
- Marketing & Launch: $5,500
- Contingency (10%): $17,910
- Total: $197,010 (pre-contingency), $216,711 (with contingency)

Next: get stakeholder approval on canonical budget and lock spending authority.
